## Usage

Use the Vault Size History button in Ribbon bar to display the graph.

Graph Legend allows to hide/show graphs for different categories of the files:

- `Markdown Files` displays .md files.
- `Other Files` displays all files with file extension other than .md.
- `All Files` displays grand total of previous two i.e. all files within the Vault.

## Settings

The settings page allows you to change the display format of the dates.

Examples of supported formats:

- mm/dd/yyyy - 01/28/2024
- m/d/yy - 1/28/24
- yyyy-mm-dd - 2024-01-28
